raxml has installed all buildable executables, which ones depends on

1.  your hardware (AVX, AVX2, SSE)
2.  whether you have MPI installed

if you either want (or need) an executable that is just called raxml,
create a symlink like this to your preferred variant:

    ln -s /usr/bin/raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-AVX2 /usr/bin/raxml
